<h1>☝️<span style="color:#dd9e15"> Personal Website 🦘👨‍🚀</span></h1>

**WHAT´S IT ABOUT?:** <br>
a little about me, my data analysis, my hobbies - there will be other things besides IT that I like to do, some contact, and I'm planning other things... for example, connecting to a home monitoring station, etc. But that's more music of the future :)
so, go on!! :-)

## Goals
I would like to have just nice personal web, novel - simply one that is not seen, and also improve it over time.. have fun with it and develop it. 🙏🧑‍💻
If anyone want to have fork for this.. it´s no prom. Will be actualy my first 😅
On web definitely muss have soma API solutions.. anything. I mean, for example weather connection, My GIt work connection, my home senzor connection, whatever.... will see 

Thank you for visiting! I hope you enjoy the website as much as I enjoyed creating it. 😊
